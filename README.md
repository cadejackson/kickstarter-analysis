# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

## Overview of Project:
### The purpose of this project was to analize Kickstarter project data specifically related to plays in order to better understand what makes a fundraising campaign successful in order to guide Louise to creating a successful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges:
### The Theater Outcomes vs Launch visualization (Figure 1) 
#### This visualization was created in order to see if there was a correlation to successful campaigns and the month in which the campaigns were launched.

## Results:
### The Theater Outcome vs Launch visulaization shows that the months of May and June are more popular for fundraising campaings related to theater.  Also, these months have the most successful campaigns in terms of quantity and the percentage of projects that are successful.  

### The Outcomes vs Goals visualization shows that the fundraising campaing goal should be < $5,000 in order to improve the liklihood that the campaign is successful.  

### In summary, it is recommended that the Kickstarter camapaign be launched in May with a fundraising goal of < $5,000 in order to be successful.

## Limitations:
### One limitation of this analyis is that there were very few projects with goals greater than $25,000.  A single successful or failed campaign can shift the percentages greatly due to the small sample size when the goal is greater than $25,000.  Another limitation is that the dataset only spans 3 years.  It is recommended that the dataset include additional years with data also being more recent.  An additional analysis that should be performed is to see if there is a correlation for featured Kickstarter campaigns (staff_picks) and success rate.
